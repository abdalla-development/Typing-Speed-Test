Portfolio
    • To provide a good user experience for this project implantations of multiple screens is a must, the first window will welcome the user and provide information of what this program is about, the second screen will generate random text each time for the user to type and calculate the typing time and the last screen will be a pop message window showing the user his result in second.
    • The hardest part of the software was to make able to generate a random text each time in order to show a good level of interaction, this is achieved by using the request model along with Open Trivia API and make the question text the text to be typed.
    • The easiest part was to calculate the typing time, considering the most important part was to figure out when to start the timer.
    • The future improvement will be of how to enhance the user experience by improving the layout.
    • The biggest learning point was being introduced to different widgets types of the Tkinter library.
